# Rahman Enclave  
### End-to-End Brand, Marketing & Sales Execution  
**A Flagship SherCorp Case Study**

## Project Overview

**Rahman Enclave** is a CDA-approved gated residential community located on **Main Lehtrar Road, Islamabad**. Developed by **Bin Abdur Rahman (Pvt) Ltd.**, the project has emerged as one of the most trusted residential developments in Zone IV of Islamabad.

SherCorp was engaged at an early stage of the project, where I served as **Marketing Manager for over seven years**. During this period, I led and executed the **entire creative, branding, digital marketing, and sales enablement ecosystem** — from initial brand identity creation to sustained revenue growth.

**Result:**  
The combined marketing and sales strategy contributed to **over PKR 2 Billion in realized real estate sales**.
